# **Project Title:** 
Data Analytics for Display Advertisement Campaign

## **Project Description:** 
This project encompasses comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques aimed at discerning the impact of display campaign advertisements on sales performance. The primary objective is to uncover actionable insights to optimize revenue generation, refine customer targeting strategies, and enhance overall business efficacy.

## Key Components and Methodologies:

Overall Analysis: Examination of total revenue and sales metrics to gauge the overarching performance of display campaign initiatives.

Product Association: Identification of product combinations frequently purchased together to inform cross-selling and upselling strategies.

Customer Segmentation: Categorize customers based on revenue levels (high, medium, low), facilitating targeted marketing efforts and personalized customer engagement.

Machine Learning: Utilization of Random Forest classification to predict if a customer will purchase single or multiple products based on features such as user type, payment type, coupon usage, country province, first/recurring order.
